- Developed a distributed memory scalable algorithm for generating low-dimensional
embeddings of large-scale high-dimensional data (10M+ data points) for
visualization, achieving a 10% improvement in convergence time over
state-of-the-art algorithms

- Developed a distributed memory framework for sparse matrix operations (SpMM,
SpGEMM, FusedMM) in machine learning kernels, achieving 3x speedup over
state-of-the-art frameworks.

- Designed and implemented over 90% of microservices-based, scalable security
middleware from scratch to cloud production deployment, providing Identity and
Access Management (IAM) capabilities for external Science Gateways.

using Apache Helix and Apache Kafka, enhancing system efficiency by 20% for
large-scale job submissions.

- Designed and implemented a scalable and highly available data ingestion pipeline
and metadata catalog for high-performance data searching for heterogeneous data
